    <p>So this was the thing i learnt now! Didnt create a repo from github but instead went to vsc and then initialized a repo, created a branch using git create origin main, changed it to main from master and thenn uhh pushged by code using git push origin main with a -u sign for the default template out there! Well at least now i know how things are working here from the basics!</p>
